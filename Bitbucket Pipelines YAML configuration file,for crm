This file is a Bitbucket Pipelines configuration file, similar to a Jenkinsfile but specific to Bitbucket. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of its key elements and functionality:

1. Global Configuration
Docker Services:

definitions:
  services:
    docker-with-more-memory:
      memory: 7168
      type: docker

A custom Docker service with 7168 MB of memory is defined to support builds requiring more memory, such as large Angular builds or SonarQube scans.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Pipelines Configuration
The pipelines section defines the steps for each branch.

Master Branch
Steps:
1. First Step: Echoes a message to confirm the commit.

2. Stage-MConsole App Build:
. Uses Node.js 16 as the image.
. Runs the Angular build commands using ng build with stage configuration.
. Artifacts (build results) are saved in Web App/ManagementConsole/dist/**.

3. Parallel Steps:
. SonarQube Scan: Uses SonarQube to analyze code quality.
. Stage-MConsole App, WebApp, and Support: Deploys the Management Console, WebApp, and Support web apps using Atlassian FTP Deploy.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PreProduction Branch
. Steps:
1. First Step: Confirms the commit on PreProduction.
2. PreProd Build MConsole App:
. Similar to the master branch, but with authorization logic to ensure only specific users can trigger the build.
3. Parallel Steps:
. Deployments of MConsole, WebApp, Support, and App with user authorization.
. Email notifications are sent after deployment via the atlassian/email-notify pipe.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Production Branch
Steps:
1. First Step: Confirms the commit on the production branch.
2. Prod Build MConsole App:
. Similar to PreProduction but for the Production environment.
3. Parallel Steps:
. Deployments of Slot-MConsole App, WebApp, Support, and App with user authorization.
. Email notifications are sent after each deployment.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Casino_CRM_Dev Branch
Steps:
1. First Step: Confirms the commit on the Casino branch.
2. Stage-Casino-MConsole App Build:
. Similar to the Master Branch, but specific to Casino_CRM_Dev.
. Uses FTP Deploy to upload build artifacts.
3. Pull Requests
. Runs a specific pipeline for pull requests on any branch.
. Simply prints a message but can be customized to run builds/tests for pull requests.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Features
. Manual Triggers: Many steps use trigger: manual, so they only run when manually initiated.
. FTP Deployments: Deployments are done via the atlassian/ftp-deploy pipe, which uploads files to an FTP server.
. Authorization:
  . The pipeline checks if the BITBUCKET_STEP_TRIGGERER_UUID matches the list of authorized users.
  . If not authorized, the pipeline exits.
Email Notifications:
. Uses atlassian/email-notify to send emails on the success or failure of deployments.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What You Should Focus On
Authorization Flow: How user UUIDs are checked before deployments.
Parallel Execution: Different web apps (MConsole, Support, WebApp) are deployed in parallel.
FTP Deployments: How deployments to remote servers are done.
Email Notifications: Custom email notifications with detailed HTML formatting.
