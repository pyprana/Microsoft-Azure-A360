The major difference between Bitbucket and other repositories (like GitHub or GitLab) lies in their target audience, integrations, and features:

Integration with Atlassian Tools: Bitbucket integrates seamlessly with Jira, Confluence, and other Atlassian products, making it ideal for teams using these tools.

Private Repositories: Historically, Bitbucket offered unlimited private repositories before GitHub did, which was a key differentiator.

Mercurial Support (Past): Bitbucket used to support Mercurial version control, unlike GitHub and GitLab, but this was discontinued in 2020.

Pricing and User Limits: Bitbucket has user-based pricing, while GitHub has repository-based pricing.

CI/CD Integration: While GitHub has GitHub Actions and GitLab has its built-in CI/CD, Bitbucket has Bitbucket Pipelines for CI/CD workflows.

Authentication and Permissions: Bitbucket provides more granular permissions at the branch, repository, and project level compared to GitHub.

Focus on Teams: Bitbucket is often seen as more team-oriented (especially for enterprises) due to its project-based repository organization.

If youâ€™re already using Atlassian tools, Bitbucket might be a better fit. Otherwise, GitHub is more popular in the open-source community, and GitLab is known for its complete DevOps lifecycle support.
